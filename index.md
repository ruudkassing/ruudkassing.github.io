*During my time studying in Delft, I developed a strong interest in solving optimization problems, particularly in control systems. From solving simple problems in student projects to working on university research projects and authoring papers on optimal control of water and irrigation systems, my passion grew. Now, I am driven to apply my technical and analytical skills to address real-world challenges and contribute to enhancing energy efficiency and reducing emissions for a sustainable society.*

I'm currently working for [Royal HaskoningDHV](https://www.royalhaskoningdhv.com/) in Amersfoort, as a full-time **Control System Developer**, since October 2019.

In my role as a control system developer within the Algorithm team at [Twinn](https://twinn.io), specializing in Water Technology, my responsibilities include designing, evaluating, and implementing **optimal control algorithms** for our range of products. This involves modelling system dynamics, developing efficient and robust optimization algorithms, and seamlessly integrating these advanced solutions into our existing products. Additionally, I focus on enhancing our **machine learning solutions** to improve the detection of anomalies in sewer networks to prevent overflows.

## Research
My research interests primarily focus on applying **mathematical optimization and control theory to advance water management**, possibly in context of agricultural systems. Some of my research involves predictive control of free-flowing open canal systems with humans-in-the-loop, operational optimization of pumped cascaded reservoirs and optimizing the allocation of irrigation water over the growth season.

## Previous Work Experiences
{% capture notice-1 %}
- **Research Assistant** - _Delft University of Technology_  
  As part of the [IWACA-TECH](http://www.iwacatech.com) project, representing TU Delft and Mobile Water Management, I served as a researcher and developer for a control system in a large-scale open canal irrigation system in Mozambique. The project aimed to enhance water use efficiency and productivity. My responsibilities included creating and validating an agro-hydrological model, developing a model for irrigation water availability and transportation, and designing a state-of-the-art decision support system using Model Predictive Control methods to optimize crop yield while considering operational constraints.

- **Product Owner and Developer** - _Mobile Water Management_  
  I developed a Python-based decision support system for a Dutch waterboard, integrating it with the Flood Early Warning System to provide optimal control advice during high-water situations. Additionally, I created mobile applications for irrigation and soil moisture monitoring in a Mozambican sugarcane plantation, processing the data and displaying it via a web app's dashboard. I also maintained relations with Dutch water boards by gathering feedback on existing water measuring solutions and informing them about updates for the staff gauge measuring mobile application.

## Education
{% capture notice-2 %}
- **Master of Science (MSc) in Systems & Control** - _Delft University of Technology_, Cum Laude   
  The master's program focused on optimization techniques and algorithms, system identification and validation, system modelling and theory, signal processing, simulation programming, MATLAB and Simulink for controller design, validation, and implementation, as well as technical writing and oral presentation skills. My main topic of interest was optimal control using model predictive control methods.

- **Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Mechanical Engineering** - _Delft University of Technology_   
  The bachelor program emphasized the design, development, and construction of technical systems for industry and consumers. It provided a wide range of skills in mathematics and physics, programming languages MATLAB and Delphi, mechanical part design using SolidWorks, structural analysis using COMSOL Finite Element Analysis software, as well as technical writing and oral presentation abilities. The topic of my minor was *'Medicine for technical students'*.
